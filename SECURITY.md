# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

As kaboome does not have a stable version yet, the only version that will be supported with security updates is the one you see on the main branch.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability head over to our discord and contact @Lamaun or use another way to contact me privately.
Alternatively you can also use the github feature at https://github.com/kaboome-org/kaboome/security/advisories
